### [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)


### What

Services serve a single entry point into the cluster for an application. 

### Why

Pods come and go, and with that their IP address change rapidly. Services decouple the IP address from the application 
and serve as the IP address inside the cluster for an application running multiple pods.
