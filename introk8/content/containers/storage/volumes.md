### Storage

### Volumes
A Volume is a designated directory in a container, which is designed to persist data, independent of the containerâ€™s life cycle

* Volume changes are excluded when updating an image
* Persist when a container is deleted
* Can be mapped to a host folder
* Can be shared between containers
